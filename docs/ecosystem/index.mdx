ZIO has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that enhance its capabilities and provide additional functionality. This ecosystem includes libraries for various purposes, such as web development, data processing, testing, and more.

But it doesn't end there! If you need a comprehensive list of libraries and tools, you can find them in one of the following sections:

- [Official libraries](officials/index.md), maintained by the ZIO team under the [ZIO Organization](https://github.com/zio).
- [Community libraries](community/index.md), maintained by members of the ZIO community.

Below are some of the highlights from the official libraries:
